# "Agent Based Models: How Can We Use Them?" presented at [MancML at ARM, 06-12-2018](https://www.mancml.io)

[Slides](https://jastark.github.io/MancMLDec2018) made using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#slide-backgrounds) â€“ so much fun to use!

## Resources I talk about:
- [Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is an agent-based modeling framework in Python. And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=69&v=bjjoHji8KUQ) is a PyDataDC 2016 talk on it by the amazing [Jackie Kazil](https://github.com/jackiekazil).
- [PyDataLondon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RglNX4c_dfc) talk by James Allen - Forecasting social inequality using agent-based modelling
- [p5*js](https://p5js.org) is the JavaScript rendition of Processing, which is used to make the agents
- Agents were built using code from the book [Nature of Code](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js) which is amazing!
- [Simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a discrete event simulation for Python
- [Explorable Explanations](https://explorabl.es/all/) hosts brilliant games to help you learn how various systems work. I use [Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/) in this talk to demonstrate agent based models in the context of segregation.
- [Loopy](https://ncase.me/loopy/) is a tool for thinking in systems
